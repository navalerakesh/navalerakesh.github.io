tagline: Exploring, researching AI, LLM, Security, MCP, and Developer productivity
description: |
  Exploring how AI, LLMs, and platform engineering come together to build safer, more
  productive developer experiences. I work on model-context protocols (MCP), secure
  knowledge workflows, and tooling that turns complex systems into reliable, explainable
  workflows for engineers.
